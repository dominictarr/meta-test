remap is not yet fully module aware

I'll want to say X -> Y and have X -> Y and X/foo -> Y/foo

then i'll be able to cross versions test node's userland... and node's lib.

currently, it can remap individual modules.

also, looses depends if there was an error during load. will need to check for that!

so, first steps:

cross version test single package versions.

test everything on multiple platforms (node versions)



so, new idea is:
  1. install EVERY npm package, replicate registry etcet.
  
  2. make registry of tests, and allow people to specify tests with remaps to run.
  
      what this look like?
      
      tests: package@version\tests\*.js
      test-adapter: [rule/adapter]
      remaps: {from: to}
      platform: node-version browser narwhal etc!
      
      return json of report.
      
      html view of report.
      
      show packages@versions tested allow remaping to different versions.
      
      if I let people specify whatever versions they want to run... 
        that will both 
          ++ get people interested
          +  help with test priority deciding problems

      push/pull hook for leting people put tests/impls in a gist or to run the tests from forks heads.
  
  3. then work on problem of deciding which different versions to run against what and displaying all information.
